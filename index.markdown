Hello! I'm Aayush.

I'm curious about tech, cricket, geopolitics, cult movies, cinematography and cooking awesome food.
I am based out of Boston, MA and I love roaming around beantown on a nice warm sunny day.
My favorite places in Boston and Cambridge are Boston Commons, Long Wharf, MIT/Harvard campus area and Quincy Market.

I am currently a Master's student at Northeastern University. I am majoring in Computer Information Systems. I aspire to be a Solutions Architect for any product that is creating an actual difference in the world. I am interested in working on building a scalable, robust and secure infrastructure for such different products.
