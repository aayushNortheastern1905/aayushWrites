## September 20th
They say birthdays are milestones, but mine felt more like speed bumps until this one changed everything. September 20th marked my 26th revolution around the sun, and the universe had its own twisted sense of timing. Someone burst into laughter while reading their phone during our planning session and announced that they were scraping H1Bs. Nothing says "happy birthday eve" quite like immigration policy chaos when you're an international student trying to build a life in America.

But this weekend was different, and I could feel it in my bones. We had spent three weeks turning our group chat into a United Nations debate about whether to go to Vegas, Atlantic City, or Miami. After all that discussion, we somehow landed on Boston, my own city. The irony wasn't lost on anyone. I watched as friends booked flights from the Bay Area, from Raleigh, from Long Island, all converging on my doorstep for what was supposed to be a destination bachelor party. Sometimes the best destinations are right where you already are.

## Before
I used to have epic birthdays when the world was simpler and friendships came easier. Back in Mumbai, my parents once rented out an entire PVR cinema for a private screening of Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Every kid from my school showed up with wrapped gifts in hand, and their parents had already negotiated pickup times with mine. Looking back now, I realize that half those friendships were brokered by our parents like tiny social contracts we were too naive to question. Maturity has a way of teaching you who your real friends are, and real friends are the ones who choose you without any parental orchestration.

Here's a truth that took me years to accept: I don't have many friends. That realization stung hard during the COVID college years when each birthday became an exercise in solitude. They were painful reminders of connections that existed only through screens. The last genuinely good birthday I'd had was in 2019, before the pandemic, before everything fell apart, before I understood what loneliness actually meant.

My first birthday in America remains etched in my memory for all the wrong reasons. I cried walking back to my empty apartment that night as the weight of being utterly alone in a foreign country finally crushed down on me. Last year, I tried something different. I went solo to a temple and prayed to Ganpati Bappa, not for celebration but for strength. Later that night, I caught a tenth anniversary screening of Whiplash for five dollars. I sat alone in that theater watching Andrew Neiman destroy himself for greatness, and somehow in that darkness, I made peace with solitude.

This year, I had resigned myself to the same routine. Then our group chat exploded with a simple message: "We're coming to Boston." Just like that, everything changed.

## Friday
Friday afternoon arrived with perfect September sunshine, and Manas landed first from Raleigh. We immediately hit Pho Basil for lunch, slurping noodles while catching up on months of life that text messages could never fully capture. After lunch, we walked the Smoot Bridge to MIT's dome, and I gave him the full Boston introduction, complete with the story of how a fraternity pledge became a unit of measurement.
My phone started buzzing at midnight India time with calls from parents, old friends, and cousins. The birthday avalanche had officially begun. For once, I silenced my phone without any guilt because I wanted to focus on the moment unfolding in front of me.
We caught the bus to Harvard for the mandatory campus tour. I showed him the Yard with its impossibly green grass, the statue everyone thinks is John Harvard but isn't, and then the actual John Harvard statue for a proper darshan. Manas kept marveling at the British colonial architecture and snapping photos like a tourist while I felt a strange pride in showing off this city that had become mine.
By the time Deodhar and Ashwin touched down at Logan, we were ready for phase two. We went back to my place for chai and quick wardrobe changes while my roommates buzzed with secondhand excitement. Then we headed off to Seaport to collect Jash.

I dragged everyone to Fan Pier Park where there's a perfect jetty and Boston's skyline reflects off the harbor like a movie poster. It's the kind of view that makes you understand why people write songs about cities. We were admiring the view when someone checked their phone and delivered the news that the H1B situation was getting worse. It was a gut punch to every international student in our group, a harsh reminder that our American dreams were hanging by bureaucratic threads.

## Boston Streets
Manas and I couldn't help ourselves as we walked through Boston proper. Every corner triggered a movie reference, and every brick building became a scene from something we'd watched together. We crossed the bridge by the Tea Party Museum and headed to North End, basically living out our own budget version of The Social Network walking scenes. We didn't have the lawsuits or billion-dollar valuations, but we had all the manic energy of young people who still believed they could change the world.

I kept pointing at random buildings and making up increasingly ridiculous startup ideas that would definitely fail. Everyone played along like we were actually onto something revolutionary. The whole thing was absurd and perfect.

Bahadkar was running late, which was typical for him, so we pivoted to Pinocchio's since it was the only place open late enough for our chaotic schedule. The pizza was warm and perfect, but the conversation was even warmer. Everyone talked over each other about everything and nothing, which is exactly what friends do when they're trying to compress months of separation into hours of presence.
Back at my apartment, my roommates had assembled a cake that looked homemade in the best possible way. We lit the candles and the singing began in at least three languages, all of it terrible but heartfelt. We made video calls to connect with friends across time zones because everyone wanted to be part of this moment.

## Saturday in Maine

Saturday morning began with a pilgrimage to the Medford temple where Ganpati Bappa deserved proper thanks for orchestrating this miracle of a reunion. The morning prayers felt different when I was surrounded by friends, like the universe was actually listening for once.
After prayers, we headed north to Acadia with the car packed full of excessive snacks and enough enthusiasm to power a small city. Our first stop was Kittery, Maine, where Lil's Cafe became the site of our breakfast excess. Nobody remembers exactly what we ordered because the menu became a challenge to try everything. But those crullers were transcendent, the kind of pastries that make you understand why people become food writers.

The drive to Acadia was peak boys' trip energy. I kept making my signature ".ai" jokes by adding it to every Marathi word I could think of. "Gammat.ai" for anything funny, "bakwas.ai" when someone said something stupid, "masti.ai" for the whole trip itself. It was idiotic and everyone loved it. We cranked up the most vulgar Honey Singh songs specifically to watch Deodhar's face contort in disgust. Every time he reached for the skip button, we'd all yell at him to keep it playing. It was pure juvenile joy at its finest. The alcohol bottles for the bachelor celebration clinked in the trunk like a percussion section accompanying our journey.

The Great Head Trail stretched out before us with 1.5 hours of pure Maine wilderness. The views at the summit made every steep climb worth it as the Atlantic Ocean stretched endlessly before us. We stood there feeling simultaneously tiny and infinite. We talked about our careers that weren't going as planned and our relationships that were complicated. We continued that ongoing Shutter Island debate because these cliffs were giving serious Shutter vibes with their dramatic drops and mysterious fog.
Darkness fell during our descent, and we became a chain of phone flashlights navigating by mutual trust and mild panic. There's something profound about depending on your friends' literal light to find your way down a mountain. It feels metaphorical in retrospect, but in the moment, we just didn't want to die.

Dinner at Streetside Cafe had a terrible name but incredible food that surprised us all. The shrimp pasta tasted like the ocean's greatest hits, and the Cajun fish sandwiches completely redefined what a sandwich could be. Everything hit perfectly after the hike had emptied us out. Our supermarket run produced Baileys, which everyone loved and which reminded us that we were actual adults now. Then came an hour's drive to Bangor with music ranging from 2000s Bollywood hits to contemporary rap, with everyone getting their turn as DJ.

## Saturday Night
We snuck two extra people into the hotel room with the confidence that only comes from perfecting this art in college. I played bartender for the night, measuring Jack Daniel's with the precision of someone who'd learned from too many amateur mistakes. I wanted tonight to be perfect.

Two drinks in, the room transformed into a comedy club where everyone was both performer and audience. My ".ai" jokes reached critical mass as I applied them to everything around us. "Hotel.ai" for our sketchy accommodation, "daaru.ai" for our drinking session, "zindagi.ai" for this whole beautiful mess. The peak moment came when Deodhar asked if he could use my napkin and I casually replied "Sorry bro, can't give it, it's personal.ai" with a completely straight face. The room exploded in laughter at the sheer absurdity of making a napkin proprietary software. Movie references flew across the room like friendly fire. Someone drunk-dialed a friend just to share the chaos, holding up the phone so they could hear us all laughing like idiots.

This was everything I'd been missing without even knowing it. This was the laughter that makes your ribs ache in the best possible way. These were the friends who understood your weirdest references without any explanation. This was finally a birthday that lived up to what birthdays were supposed to be: celebrations of being alive, surrounded by people who actively chose to be there.

Somewhere between the third round of drinks and the fourth startup joke, a profound realization hit me. They say a man lives two lives, and the second one starts when he realizes he only has one. I was twenty-six years old and finally starting my second life. Not because I was dying or being dramatic, but because I finally understood something crucial. Waiting for perfect moments meant missing all the imperfect ones that were actually perfect. These friends had flown across the country not for Vegas glamour or Miami beaches but for Boston, for me, for us. The careful life I'd been living, always protecting myself from disappointment, wasn't really living at all.

## The Epilogue : Sunday and After

![bakchodi in room]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/acadia/1 (4).jpg)
Sunday morning brought us to Thunder Hole where the Atlantic crashes against granite with enough force to shake your bones and reset your soul. Maine was showing off because it knew we needed a grand finale. The spray hit our faces like nature's own blessing, salty and cold and impossibly alive. We took more photos and made more jokes, everyone trying to capture something that couldn't be photographed. Then we went to Portland for lunch where we ate like the world was ending.

Dinner at Mirchi Nation came with spice levels that made us question our choices, but we questioned them in the best way. Then we went to Jash's birthday celebration because September babies unite in their Virgo madness. In the rental car heading home, Ashwin, Manas, and Akshay dropped me off. The weekend deflated like a punctured balloon, but it left something permanent behind. The apartment felt different when I walked in because I was bringing the warmth of the weekend back with me.
Twenty-six complete orbits around the sun had passed, and I finally had a birthday worth the wait. Sometimes you need six years of mediocre birthdays to truly appreciate when lightning strikes. Lightning struck this time in the form of friends who flew across the country to remind me that I matter. They reminded me that quality beats quantity every single time and that five real friends are worth more than fifty acquaintances.

They're still scraping H1Bs, and the future remains uncertain. My visa status is still a question mark hovering over every career decision I make. But for one weekend in September, none of that mattered. We were just friends making memories in Maine, adding ".ai" to everything and laughing until it hurt in the way that heals you.

Some birthdays you endure by pushing through them like obligations. Some birthdays you survive by marking time until the clock resets. This one was different because I truly lived it. This one reminded me that I'd been so afraid of my one life ending that I'd forgotten to let it begin. This one I'll remember not just for what happened but for who I became. I became someone who finally understood that birthdays aren't about getting older but about growing into the life that's been waiting for you all along.

The second life starts now.
