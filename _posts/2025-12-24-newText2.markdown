"There are years that ask questions and years that answer them." ~ Zora Neale Hurston

It's the last week of December, and I'm sitting in my Boston apartment with a drink in my hand, watching the city I once hated twinkle outside my window as it snows. I am mentally ready to see it all snow capped by tomorrow morning. In two weeks, I will leave this place. In two weeks, this chapter will close.

The year 2025 asked me every question I was afraid to answer. And somehow, against all odds, I found the replies I needed.
I remember August 2017 like it was yesterday. I was moving into COEP hostel in Pune for the first time. My parents made my bed, organized my cupboard, and set everything up with that quiet care only parents have. When they finally left, I didn't cry. Instead, I felt something else entirely: possibility. The air smelled different that day. The world felt bigger than it ever had before. I was standing at the edge of something new, something that belonged only to me, and I was ready to fall into it headfirst.
September 1st, 2023 felt exactly the same way. I landed in Boston and moved into my first American apartment. My roommates and I celebrated with Jack Daniel's that first week, laughing too loud and feeling invincible. I remember thinking to myself, "This is it. This is my second chance at everything."

I had come to Northeastern wanting redemption. At COEP, I had been an average student: someone with a 7.0 GPA who did nothing particularly remarkable, who partied more than he studied, and who only graduated because COVID gave us online exams. I had gotten a good job at eQ Technologic after graduation, which was something to be proud of. But deep down, I knew I had wasted four years of real learning. This time around, I wanted to do it right. I wanted to be great at something meaningful.
But America had different plans for me.

The disillusionment came slowly at first, and then all at once.

I had seen my friends go to schools like Georgia Tech and UT Austin, places where everyone seemed sharp and hungry for success. At Northeastern, I found myself surrounded by people from tier 3 and tier 4 colleges in India: places like random institutions that nobody had ever heard of. Many of these were people who had taken five years to finish their engineering degrees because of backlogs and KTs, and yet they were sitting in the same classroom as me. I'm not trying to sound elitist here, because I genuinely believe that your college doesn't define who you are. I believe that soft skills and real technical ability matter far more than any brand name on your degree. But even so, I couldn't help but notice the pattern that was emerging.

Look, I know someone who's genuinely exceptional. Someone I actually look up to. At the first Diwali party I attended in Boston, he asked me a question that stuck with me: "You went to COEP. What are you doing here?" I didn't know what to say. I still don't. Maybe he had a point. Maybe I should have aimed higher. I don't know. But what I do know is that he was the exception, not the rule. And being surrounded by people who weren't operating at that level made me question everything about my decision to come here.

I found myself sitting in classrooms where we were learning Java Swing: a technology so outdated that my younger sister could have taught the class. There were web development courses where the first class covered HTML and CSS basics. There were assignments so simple, yet I watched people copy them without any shame whatsoever. I saw a guy copying code for a weather app that we had to build for a React assignment. Dude, come on. This is a master's course we're talking about. A weather app with a ready made API. That's the level we were operating at.

And then there were the professors. I watched some of them operate on a quid pro quo system: take both my courses and maybe I'll make you a TA, regardless of whether you have a 4.0 GPA or genuine technical knowledge. Meanwhile, someone whose only accomplishment was copying assignments and checking the right boxes would get the position. I had left everything behind in India, a good job, my family, my comfort, to deal with this kind of absurdity. It was hard to swallow.

I don't say any of this to sound arrogant. I say it because I was genuinely confused by what I was witnessing. These were the same people who would party every single weekend, drink until they couldn't stand up straight, survive on nothing but instant noodles and anime, and then turn around and complain about how hard their lives were. They would extend their degrees by a semester or two, skip out on co-op opportunities, or settle for unpaid internships just so they could say they had done something. They would get screening calls from companies and celebrate like they had just won the lottery, with everyone congratulating each other with enthusiastic declarations of "good job." But you know what really scares me? There are no two words in the English language more dangerous than "good job," especially when those words are handed out for simply existing, for meeting the bare minimum requirement. Because that is exactly how mediocrity becomes comfortable in your life. That is exactly how people stop pushing themselves to be better.

And what was I doing during all of this? I was grinding away every single day. I was applying to hundreds of jobs and getting rejected from hundreds of jobs. I was watching my bank account shrink with each passing month. I was feeling guilty every single time I went out with friends because I wasn't being "productive enough" with my time.

December 2023 was the absolute worst month of that first year. Two of my actual friends, the ones I genuinely enjoyed spending time with, left Boston for New York. I was stuck in the apartment with two other roommates. Don't get me wrong, they're good people and I consider them as good friends, but that month was rough. Our place had essentially turned into a dumpster. Nobody was cleaning up after themselves. Nobody was buying groceries for the house. I would walk to Whole Foods all alone in the freezing cold, come back to a filthy kitchen, and sit there wondering what the hell I was doing with my life.

I remember New Year's Eve of that year vividly. We were all drunk, laughing our heads off, stumbling back from Seaport in the early morning hours. Technically speaking, these were good memories that I was making. But even in that moment, I couldn't shake this overwhelming feeling, this sense of dread, that nothing was actually going to change for me. I felt like I was going to be stuck in this endless loop forever.

Spring semester brought more of the same frustrations. I watched the people around me live like there was no tomorrow, while I was living like there was nothing but tomorrow stretching out endlessly before me. I was enrolled in a class called Advanced Business Process Engineering, filled with people who had extended their degrees just so they could "find jobs," but they never actually searched for anything. There was one guy in particular who spent the entire semester flirting with girls in the class instead of ever opening LinkedIn. There was a girl who was clearly battling her own deep insecurities at the age of 26, spending all her energy seeking validation instead of focusing on her future.

I met people who were doing off campus jobs illegally and didn't seem to care about the consequences at all. I met people who talked about doing unpaid co-ops as if it was the most normal thing in the world. I met people who would lie on their resumes, cheat on their assignments, and still somehow sleep soundly at night without any guilt.

I had always respected women throughout my life. The women in my family, my friends back home in India, they all carried themselves with dignity and grace. They all had standards they refused to compromise on. Even my ex girlfriend, despite everything that happened between us, was someone who commanded genuine respect. But here in Boston, I watched relationships fall apart in ways I hadn't seen before. I saw someone with a long distance relationship back in India, celebrating Diwali with their partner on video calls, only to be with someone else in Boston all this time. I need to be clear here. I am not saying all women behave this way. I am not even saying that most women do this. But I saw enough of these situations to make me question everything I thought I knew about loyalty, about love, about what people are truly capable of when nobody is watching them.

And the men? They are even worse than the women, if not completely delusional about their own situations. I have personally seen a 28 year old man who worked for four solid years in India, who is now completely unemployed and surviving on OPT, spending his days being "chummy" with some woman who is four years younger than him. 

I started wondering to myself: If these people are here at Northeastern and I am also here at Northeastern, then maybe I am actually the stupid one in this entire situation. Maybe I am the one who doesn't get how things really work.

But then something fundamental shifted inside of me.

My co-op position at EmTech actually worked out successfully. I started traveling around the country whenever I could afford it. I met people from other universities: places like Stony Brook, ASU, SJSU, and Santa Clara. I saw with my own eyes how differently these students thought about their futures. I saw how much harder they worked on their projects and assignments. I saw how seriously they took their careers and their goals. That is when I finally realized that Northeastern wasn't the whole story of graduate education in America. It was just my particular story, my particular experience.

I started writing regularly. I wrote for this blog that you are reading right now. I started writing articles for The Huntington News. I made a conscious decision to spend my time only with people who genuinely matched my energy levels, my ambition, and my core values. I used the money I earned from my co-op to explore different parts of America, to see with my own eyes what I was really up against in this country, and to understand exactly how far I still had to go to achieve my goals.

I learned something during this time that my English teacher back in high school would have absolutely loved. Sherlock Holmes was completely right when he said his famous line. When you systematically eliminate everything that is impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable it might seem, must be the actual truth. And the truth that I discovered was this: I could not control my environment or the people around me, but I could absolutely control how I responded to that environment.

Lord Krishna says something profound in the Bhagavad Gita: "Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana." What this means is that you have the right to perform your actions and your duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of those actions. Your duty as a warrior is simply to fight the battle in front of you, not to spend your time worrying about whether you will achieve victory or suffer defeat.

So that is exactly what I did. I fought every single day with everything I had.
Somewhere along this difficult journey, I completely stopped hating Boston.
I vividly remember the day when I cried in this very apartment, telling my roommate through tears that I absolutely could not stand this city anymore. It was too cold for someone from Mumbai. It was too expensive for my limited budget. It was too lonely for someone far from home. But now, sitting here just two weeks before I have to leave, I genuinely cannot imagine my life without being able to walk to Boston Common whenever I feel like it. I cannot imagine not being able to complain loudly about the MBTA and its constant delays. I cannot imagine not eating hot miso ramen at Waku Waku on a freezing cold night when I need comfort food. I cannot imagine not taking the Red Line train all the way to Harvard just so I can enjoy that perfect scenic view when the train leaves Charles MGH station and the Charles River suddenly appears before your eyes.

Boston became my very first American home in every sense of that word. This city made me into the person I am today. It gave me both the good experiences and the bad experiences. It gave me the crushing loneliness and the meaningful personal growth. It gave me the painful failures and the eventual hard won success.

And now I am leaving all of it behind.

I am heading off to the Midwest to start my new job. I am moving into a completely new chapter of my life. Maybe this next chapter will be an even lonelier one than what I experienced in Boston. Maybe it will be even harder than anything I have faced so far. But I have learned something absolutely crucial during my time here: you have got to start somewhere, anywhere at all, and then you have got to just keep going no matter what happens. Consistency and discipline will beat motivation every single time, without exception. There's a reason why the slope of the line matters so much more than the y intercept, because how fast you're improving matters more than where you started.

This is the final curtain on Boston, on this version of myself. Every magic trick has three parts, right? The pledge. The turn. The prestige. Well, I've made my pledge. The turn tore me apart. But the prestige? That's still coming. And when it does, it's going to be something worth remembering.
